*Include method signatures and line numbers.
If your project group wrote more than two custom functions, choose the 
two functions that were most extensively tested.*

1.

2.

### H. List the line numbers where you test each of your two custom methods twice.
*For each of the four tests (two for each method), explain what was being
tested and the expected result. For non-textual results (e.g. graphical or
auditory), you may describe in your own words what the expected result
should be or reference output files (e.g. images, audio files).*

## Citing Resources

### A. List below *EVERY* resource your project group looked at
*Bullet lists and links suffice.*





### B. Did you cite every resource that influenced your code in the code itself?
*Every resource that informed your code should be cited in a comment at/near the
line(s) of code that it informed.*

**Yes or No?**

### C. Did you receive help from classmates, past COS 126 students, or anyone else?
*If so, please list their names. ("A Sunday lab TA" or "Office hours on
Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)*

## Submission Checklist
*Please mark that you’ve done all of the following steps
(fill in square bracket with x, i.e. [x]):*

* [ ] Created a project.zip file, unzipped its contents, and checked that our
    compile and run commands work on the unzipped contents. Ensure that the .zip
    file is under 50MB in size.
* [ ] Created and uploaded a Loom or YouTube video that...
  * [ ] is maximum 2 minutes in length 
  * [ ] demonstrates live your program's input(s) and output(s)
  * [ ] demonstrates live your 3 features
  * [ ] does **not** reveal any code
  * [ ] includes your project name and the name of each student
  * [ ] has its thumbnail and/or starting frame set to an image of your program
        or a title slide
  * [ ] is publicly viewable (check in an incognito browser)
  * [ ] is linked to in this `implementation.md` file (Q10 under Basic Information)  
* [ ] Uploaded all .java files to TigerFile. Each .java file should be uploaded 
      separately as an additional file.
* [ ] Uploaded project.zip file to TigerFile.

*After you’ve submitted the above on TigerFile, **remember to do the following**:*
* [ ] Complete and upload this `implementation.md` file to TigerFile.
* [ ] Complete and submit this Google Form
    (https://forms.cs50.io/27ca51e0-4d81-4d97-8621-ba1e5d26cd78).


## Partial Credit: Bug Report(s)
*For partial credit for buggy features, you may include a bug report for at
most 4 bugs that your project group was not able to fix before the submission
deadline. For each bug report, copy and paste the following questions and
answer them in full. Your bug report should be detailed enough for the grader
to reproduce the bug.*

***Note:** if your code appears bug-free, you should **not** submit any bug reports.*

### BUG REPORT #1:
**1. Describe in a sentence or two the bug below.**




**2. Describe in detail how to reproduce the bug (e.g. run commands, user input, 
etc.).**




**3. Describe the resulting effect of bug and provide evidence
(e.g. copy-and-paste the buggy output, reference screenshot files and/or buggy
output files, include a Loom video of reproducing and showing the effects of
the bug, etc.).**




**4. Describe where in your program code you believe the bug occurs (e.g. line
numbers).**




**5. Please describe what steps you tried to fix the bug.**





## Extra Credit

### A. Going above and beyond the scope of COS126

#### Did your program go above and beyond the scope of COS126?

**Yes or No?** YES

*If yes, please answer the following question.*

#### Describe in detail how your program went above and beyond the scope of COS126.

- Swing
- Volatily/Threads and Concurrency

### B. Runtime Analysis

#### Did you analyze the efficiency of a substantial component of your project?

**Yes or No?** YES

*If yes, please answer the following questions.*

**1. Specify the scope of the component you are analyzing
(e.g. function name, starting and ending lines of specific .java file).**

Model method


**2. What is the estimated runtime (e.g. big-O complexity) of this component?
Provide justification for this runtime (i.e. explain in your own words why
you expect this component to have this runtime performance).**

linear (n) 

//TODO: Complete this


**3. Provide experimental evidence in the form of timed analysis supporting this
runtime estimate. (Hint: you may find it helpful to use command-line
arguments/flags to run just the specified component being analyzed).**




### C. Packaging project as an executable .jar file

#### Did you package your project as an executable .jar file?

**Yes or No?**

*If yes, please answer the following question.*

#### Describe in detail how to execute your .jar application (e.g. what execution command to use on the terminal).
*Include a few example execution commands and the expected results of running
your program. For non-textual outputs (e.g. graphical or auditory), feel free
to describe in words what the output should be or reference output files
(e.g. images, audio files) of the expected output.*
